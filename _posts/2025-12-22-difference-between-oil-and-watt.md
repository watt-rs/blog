## 🧭 History

The *Watt project* in the Rust programming language has been around for a year now. 
Initially, the project started as a simple interpreted, lightweight, dynamically typed language on Rust. 
Under this concept, the project developed for about 9 months without any major conceptual or philosophical changes, 
quite successfully. But development does not stand still. Evolution is inevitable.

*Some time ago (about 4 months)*, the concept and philosophy of the *Watt language* was radically revised, 
and the launch of the statically typed programming language *Oil* for the Javascript platform was announced. 
I'll be honest — the revision of the concept was primarily motivated by my desire to move away from dynamics 
in favor of statics, after studying type systems, type inference, and type checking in more detail.

The name of the project was chosen completely at random, the first thing that came to mind, so to speak. 
Over time, realizing that I didn't really like the name, I decided to transfer the Oil concept to Watt. 
Since then, the Oil project has been closed.

At the moment, there are ideas to implement the Oil project
as a native backend for Watt, so **Oil can be considered frozen**. 🥶

🌺 *I hope this helped resolve the ongoing confusion :)*
